.Overview
====
This post explains how we execute Arquillian tests into a Docker container, so we'll talk about :

* {uri-docker-asciidoctorj-github}[docker-asciidoctorj], the dedicated project on Asciidoctor organization
* {uri-asciidoctor-dockerhub}[the Asciidoctor organization on Docker Hub],
* {uri-arquillian-cube-github}[Arquillian Cube], the Arquillian extension that can be used to manager Docker containers from Arquillian.
* {uri-jboss-wildfly-docker}[the WildFly docker image] from JBoss

It's been a while since I +wrote+ here but like many technicals blogger (I guess), I've a lot of blog posts on draft mode. And I've a lot to write about 2014 which was
an *AMAZING year* : indeed, thanks to the {uri-asciidoctor}[*Asciidoctor project*] and +Java EE 7 / WildFly+ technologies, I gave *2 talks* at {link-devnation-talk}[+DevNation, San Francisco+] to speak about Open Source projects :)  +
But I'll blog about it +awesome experience+ soon.

*So what this post is about : Docker ? Asciidoctor ? Arquillian ?*

.The power of Arquillian & Docker for testing AsciidoctorJ

You've just read the title and you said : +

- _"Oh no ! Not another post about Docker!"_, 

and I want to answer +

- _"Well, it's 2015, is it possible to write a blog post without mentionning Docker ?_" +

Serioulsy, it's more a blog post about the {uri-asciidoctorj-github}[AsciidoctorJ] project and how {uri-docker}[Docker] helps us to easily check that AsciidoctorJ can be execute into a Java EE application server like WildFly. +
So it's not a post about Docker itself but more a use case where Docker is the key to the ease of tests...OK you're right, it's about Docker :)

== Asciidoctor on the JVM with AsciidoctorJ

I guess that I don't need to introduce Asciidoctor now that it became so popular since it's was started by {uri-twitter-dan-allen}[*Dan Allen*] at the end of 2012.
But
Like you know now, Asciidoctor is a toolchain that give you the

----
AsciidoctorJ is the official library for running Asciidoctor on the JVM.
Using AsciidoctorJ, you can convert AsciiDoc content or analyze the structure of a parsed AsciiDoc document from Java and other JVM languages

== AsciidoctorJ in a Java application server ?

So here we have a problem 
The problem is that if you want to include AsciidoctorJ in your Java application, it's not easy. Indeed, AsciidoctorJ is base on JRUby and
we have some classloader troubles with JRuby see bugs and discussions below :

- bug1
- bug2
- bug3

=== How do we solve it in a first way

We tried

=== The power of Arquillian & Docker

OK so we have a solution but there are several manual steps to follow in order to have 

==== Arquillian Cube extension to the rescue !

Arquillian Cube is a very cool project developed by Alex Soto and the Arquillian community

===== Used the Docker image from a registry (remote or local)

. How to build the Docker image with docker command :
.. Clone this project :

 $ git clone https://github.com/mgreau/docker-asciidoctorj.git

.. Build the Docker image

  cd docker-asciidoctorj
  docker build -t asciidoctor/asciidoctorj-wildfly82 dockerfiles/wildfly82/

. How to execute the Arquillian Tests using an existing Docker image
.. Ensure Java, Maven and Docker are installed, and that the Docker image *asciidoctor/asciidoctorj-wildfly82* is present in your registry.

  docker images
  
.. Execute tests (Start a container / Execute tests / Stop and destroy the container)

  mvn clean test -Pwildfly82
  
[IMPORTANT]
====
 Until the Docker image is present in your registry, you can just execute the Maven command (2b) !
====

===== All in one with Arquillian : Build the Docker image and execute tests in a container

. Clone this project :

 $ git clone https://github.com/mgreau/docker-asciidoctorj.git

. Ensure Java, Maven and Docker are installed
. Execute tests (Build a docker image / Start a container / Execute tests / Stop and destroy the container)

  mvn clean test -Pwildfly82_dockerfile

If you want to customize the container, you can update the dockerfile and re-lauch the Maven command

===== Convert AsciiDoc to PDF and HTML5 

The tests are very basic for now, they will convert the same sample.adoc file to sample.pdf 

== AsciidoctorJ in your favorite Java application server ?

It seems that the *JRuby* classloader problem is solve with the use of *JBoss Modules components*. +
But if you want to quickly test AsciidoctorJ in your favorite Java application server +
If you're using another Java application server than WildFly AS like TomEE...feel free to fork the project and quickly tests if it works into
application server, here are the steps to follow :

 . Fork the GitHub repository {uri-docker-asciidoctorj}[docker-asciidoctorj] 
 . Create a +Dockerfile+ file in a +dockerfiles+ subfolder, following the named convention +{appservername}{version}+
 . Update the +src/test/resources/arquillian.xml+ file to add a docker container
 . Update the +pom.xml+ to add Maven profiles related to the application server
 . Execute tests (maybe create a dedicated test) and see the results

If you do it, I'd love to have your feedbacks so feel free to add a comment here, on the discussion list or on the GitHub project. +
We are waiting for PR :)

== Asciidoctor has its own official registry on Docker Hub

The good news here is that the asciidoctor project now have an easy way to test if the future versions will be compatible with this architecture.
The other good news is that the

Have fun with *Asciidoctor*, *Arquillian* and *Docker* :)
